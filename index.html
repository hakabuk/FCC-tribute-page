        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>
        <b>Thomas Alva Edison</b> (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.
        </p>
                <p>
          Edison developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb.</p>
        <p>Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.
